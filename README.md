If you want to start the project locally you need to enter the comand in terminal "HOST=0.0.0.0 &&npm run start" then enter your IP url not "localhost" because api from Imgur Server will not allow you to fetch them. (ERROR 429)
I created this project by using redux-saga for state menagment,for styling i used "styled components", for fetching api i used "axios" and for icons i used "MUI".I tryed to make it as UI friendly as possible olso responsive.Used Jest and react-testing-library to test some of components.As code liner i used Prettier olso you can see the configuration file.
