# Imgur Gallery
•The project is live at __https://rediibra.github.io/Imgur-Grid-Gallery/__. <br>
## IMPORTANT NOTES BEFORE YOU OPEN THE LINK 
• If the page __will not show the images__, please reload the page until it does (api issue).<br>
• If you want to start the project locally, you need to enter the command in the terminal "npm start," then enter your IP url, not "localhost," because the API from Imgur Server will not allow you to fetch them. (ERROR 429)<br>
• In this project, I includet mp4 files and gifs,but I chose to show them as "imagine not found," but I still showed the information about them. <br>
