If you want to start the project locally you need to enter the comand in terminal "npm start" then enter your IP url not "localhost" because api from Imgur Server will not allow you to fetch them. (ERROR 429)
I created this project by using redux-saga for state menagment olso worked with props,for styling i used "styled components", for fetching api i used "axios" and for icons i used "MUI".I tryed to make it as UI friendly as possible olso responsive.Used Jest and react-testing-library to test some of components(demo).As code liner i used Prettier olso you can see the configuration file.In this project i includet mp4 files and gif,but i decited to show them as "imagine not found"(because project was about showing only imagines) but i still show the informations about them.
I enjoyed making this challenge and it was fun working on it.
If you have any question feel free to email me.
